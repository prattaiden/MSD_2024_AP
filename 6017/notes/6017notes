syntax to define is the ,
tuples get printed in ()

each entry in the series has as key and a value
if dont provide key, it is integer 0 -

box plot of all the values for HW1

linear regression
- predictions
assume that as change sqft a little price change a little

predict closest value nearest neighbor
best?
do my predictions match the data

prediction for particular point
bo bi xi

best line - arg min
find beta0 and beta1 - sum up expression over all data points

next try min |pred(xi) - yi|

min prediction(xi)- yi ^2 - least squares fit

residual sum of squares = error - regression - scale dependent

how can we get something that is not scale dependent
total sum of squares
TSS = su, (yi - mean of y)^2
relative error r2
tss - rss / tss = 1 - tss/tss = r2

if no error , r squared = 1
RSS <= TSS

linear regresiion, take data points, plug in to get betas and best lines
