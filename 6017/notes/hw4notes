Quad Tree
bounding box

make internal node
searching: start at root, make sure it overlaps before recurssing down to children

KT TREE
split by x coordinate
then by median y value
repeat til run out of points

stuff needed for implementation
KD Tree Class
methods for knn and range query
they have a driver and a recursive implementation

constructor of the tree is simple
  makes the root

need a Node class
  recurssive constructor
  what data associate with nodes of KD Tree?
  point
  left and right children

Point Class
Access Align Bounding boxes
priority queue

quad tree differences
node
  4 children
  nw ,ne , sw, se
