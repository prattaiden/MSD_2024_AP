identify unique tuples


keys in rdbms

  like superset
  all possible keys that can be formed from a relation or a table

entity relationship model
every relation should have a primary key and unique key

mysql workbench
- figure out how to get into the cade machines

attribute is the name and the type - entity - tuple - row

candidate key:
options for hte primary keys

my sql data types
integers, intm tiny, small, medium, big , int
real , float, double, decimal
dates , date , datetime, time stamp, time, year

  char(10), varchar(1)
  char is exactly 10 characters
  varchar 10 up to ten characters
  enums

strings
choosing the N for varchar
varchar(n)
n bytes plus 1 or 2 bytes
1byte if N <=255
2bte if N>255

properties
DEFAULT 'hello' -
AUTO-INCREMENT - goes to the next value up
NOT NULL

table properties
  primary key (column, or multiple)
  unique (column 1 ) - candidate key

create table Titles(
  ISBN char(14) not null,
  Title varchar(255) not null,
  Author varchar(255) not null,
  primary key(ISBN)
)
mysql makes its own column for primary key if you dont specify

Foreign key(<column>) References <table> (table's key)

on delete cascade - deletes all corresponding rows
om delete restrict - prevents you from deleting the row

many to many
primary keys of relation entities as foreign keys
relationship sets to schema

on the many side, can merge one of the relationships into its table
1 to many mergre to many side
since we

in a 1to1
treat as a 1 to M and merge to one of the other tables

algoirthm summary slide::::::
MANY TO MANY - create table for relationship
1 to many - dont have to create schema for relationship, the many side table has the foreign key from the 1
1 to 1 -
