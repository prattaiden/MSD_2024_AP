keys and superkeys
 and subsets


video for super key and
super key: set of attributes that can uniquely identify each row

keys video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UZLrD_R0T4

identify unique tuples


keys in rdbms

super key:
  like superset
  all possible keys that can be formed from a relation or a table

key and super key
no tuples contain duplicates


foreign key constraint

delete corresponding records - cascade

nullify foreign key

disallow changes to the reference table

entity relationship model
every relation should have a primary key and unique key

mysql workbench
- figure out how to get into the cade machines

attribute is the name and the type - entity - tuple - row

candidate key:
options for hte primary keys
surrogate key:
state id 24 stands in for state code GA

ER Models
my sql data types
integers, intm tiny, small, medium, big , int
real , float, double, decimal
dates , date , datetime, time stamp, time, year
strings
  char(10), varchar(1)
  char is exactly 10 characters
  varchar 10 up to ten characters
  enums

5/23
strings
choosing the N for varchar
varchar(n)
n bytes plus 1 or 2 bytes
1byte if N <=255
2bte if N>255

properties
DEFAULT 'hello' -
AUTO-INCREMENT - goes to the next value up
NOT NULL

table properties
  primary key (column, or multiple)
  unique (column 1 ) - candidate key

create table Titles(
  ISBN char(14) not null,
  Title varchar(255) not null,
  Author varchar(255) not null,
  primary key(ISBN)
)
mysql makes its own column for primary key if you dont specify

Foreign key(<column>) References <table> (table's key)

on delete cascade - deletes all corresponding rows
om delete restrict - prevents you from deleting the row

many to many
primary keys of relation entities as foreign keys
relationship sets to schema

on the many side, can merge one of the relationships into its table
1 to many mergre to many side
since we

in a 1to1
treat as a 1 to M and merge to one of the other tables

algoirthm summary slide::::::
MANY TO MANY - create table for relationship
1 to many - dont have to create schema for relationship, the many side table has the foreign key from the 1
1 to 1 -

database systems wrapping up
mySQL use primarykey() , candidate key is unique

relational algebra
projection
selection
set union
set difference
cross product

cardinality and participation constraint
cardinality 1 to many, many to many, 1 to 1
if caridnality is differnet, tables will be differnt

weak entitiy!!
cant be defined by own attributes, cant be found on its own

self join
cross

select p1.cardNum, p2.cardNum where
select * from Phones

select * from Phones p1 join Phoens p2 where p1.CardNum!=p2.CardNum and p1.phone = p2.phone;

null
sql uses 3 value logic
true false and unknown
null in sql = unknown


quiz
select patrons.name from patrons join checkedout where patrons.cardnum = checkedout.cardnum


give me all the patrons from patrons where cardnum not in checked out
outerjoin

select * from Patrons where CardNum not in (select CardNum from CheckedOut)

select * from patrons natural left join checkedout

 natural and outer join and left join

 Join/Inner Join = Keep only that which matches
Left join = Keep every thing from left table, only matches from right table
Right join = Keep everything from right table, only matches from left table
Outer join = Keep everything
